Lecturer dr. P.J. Klok","The goal of the Master Class is to prepare students for the writing of their thesis. Although Master students typically have heterogeneous backgrounds and interests, every thesis shares some building blocks. These building blocks are central to the Master Class, and students are required to shape and connect these during a series of assignments during the course. Thus, the Master Class results in an elaborated framework for the thesis.  In addition to the materials covered by the Master Class, you should also use the Guide to Methodology Readings and other tools provided by the Canvas-Site.

Lecturer drs. M.H. Tempelman","This project course first provides participants with the necessary skills for the preparation of academic research articles and manuscripts in English. In the first part of the course students will be taught the techniques of effective information searching, the ways to work with scientific articles and evaluate them, and the conventions used in literature citation and referencing. This part of the course will be assessed with a literature review based on, at least, 10 scientific articles. After a successful completion of this part, students are expected to be proficient in writing academic papers (e.g. literature reviews, conceptual papers, research proposals, theses). The subsequent second part of the course will elaborate further on the literature review in terms of  the actual design, and implementation of a quantitative (experimental or correlational) study resulting in an individual written research report. Looking at the various stages of the empirical research cycle, students will: a) conceptualize their research in a literature review, b) design the research methods and instruments in order to collect data; c) perform statistical data analysis to provide the research findings; and d) reflect on the research findings and research design in the discussion section. During the project course students will work in groups to conceptualize and operationalize the research, but assessment is based on individual written deliverables. Based on an inventory of preferences concerning various research themes, students will be divided in groups and linked to a supervisor. During the course, supporting (on-campus, online or pre-recorded) lectures will be provided, as well as group meetings with the supervisor to guide students when working on their research. The course will be assessed by means of a literature review (25%), a written report (70%) and active participation (5%).

Over the course students develop the knowledge and skills relevant for preparing a research design, formulating research questions, selecting appropriate methodology, conducting a review of the scientific literature and writing an academic text following scientific convention.

The main learning objective is that graduates get academic and research skills like independently searching for and identifying additional literature, critically reflecting and discussing on issues in the domain, taking responsibility for his or her development, designing a research proposal and executing and reporting on an (applied) research project. Graduates are able to give a structured written and oral presentation in English about individual work.
After following the training on research ethics, students are able to recognize ethical issues which may arise in the context of their research and are able to ethically test their research proposals for impact on human subjects.
After following the training on academic writing, students are able to identify problem areas in their own texts, apply the scientific norms related to giving proper credit and referencing and the scientific conventions for academic writing.

Connection to the work field
Learning sciences is an applied discipline, so as a graduate of this track you should have some insight in educational practice. This course introduces you to assessments that are used in education. Among other things, you will be familiarized with standardized progress monitoring tests of reading comprehension and mathematics used in elementary schools and learn how scores are computed and transformed into proficiency levels (A to E, or I to V). You will also discuss how testing services such as Cito adapt their progress monitoring tests to the ability level of each child, and whether and how such computer-adaptive testing is as accurate as non-adaptive testing. Finally, you will be introduced to and evaluate some prevalent ways to differentiate instruction, including the reasons why differentiation is (too) difficult for most elementary school teachers.

Understanding how this leads to an increased demand of flexibility in transport and energy availability in our future (smart) society, and to a wide diversity in type and scale of aircraft and wind turbines.
 
This course provides the essential physical background and aerodynamic knowledge and skills to be able to contribute to design and optimization of aircraft and wind turbines, where we particularly focus on the relatively low speed regime. The student will learn fundamental knowledge, analytical skills, and many insights that will help to critically evaluate designs, contribute to new designs, and critically evaluate results of numerical simulations. This general goal is subdivided in
  Physics of Aerodynamic Flows: The student will be able to derive the governing equations of fluid motion, describe the properties of atmospheric air and their relationships.  
Flow-Field Modeling: Based on the decomposition of the aerodynamic velocity field in associated source and vorticity fields the student can setup effective engineering models for the inviscid flow field by introducing idealizations and simplifications to the governing equations.
Viscous Effects in Aerodynamic Flows: Students can model and quantify changes to an inviscid aerodynamic flow caused by the presence of viscous wall boundary layers and trailing wakes.
Boundary Layer Analysis: By identifying relevant boundary layer parameters, deriving the governing equations, and formulating solution methods, the student can model the viscous flow in boundary layers. The student will gain knowledge and skills to understand laminar and turbulent boundary layer behavior and its connection to the inviscid flow region, viscous losses, and airfoil drag.
